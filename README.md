# Md Al Mamun's MERN CRUD App with JWT Authentication Project

This is a solution to the [Md Al Mamun's MERN CRUD App with JWT Authentication Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpoaZ73xBrE). I'm testing my hand creating very simple (follow along) projects for now to get familiar with the matter.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox 
- CSS Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework (No)
- Tailwind CSS  
- Typescript (No)
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

### What I learned

- Token creation typically occurs during the authentication phase of a user's lifecycle. The user logs in, the server validates the credentials, then generates a JWT (JSON Web Token) as a means of authentication. The generated token is then sent back to the client in the response. The client stores the received token in an HTTP cookie or in local storage. For all subsequent requests requiring authentication (e.g., accessing protected routes), the client includes the token in the request headers.    
- I used DaisyUI in production, and it made UI work much easier by far.    
- How to alter the .eslintrc.cjs file for custom performance  
- Project turned out to be a React Router DOM fundamentals refresher course. Next.js route simplicity had almost made me totally forget about React Router.   
- Note that  
A] You can actually log in with any input. This is done just to generate a token. Ditto for signup. Login and Signup also required before access to edit or delete is granted.  
B] The search bar and options on the NavBar do not work. They are only there for UI purposes and are not wired up with the required functionality.  

### Continued development

- Keep coding everyday and increasing competency!
